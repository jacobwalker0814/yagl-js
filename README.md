Yet Another [Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Implemented on an HTML5 canvas and pure JavaScript.

Open Issues:

* Make it prettier
* Mouse coordinates are a bit off
* Option to save/load games to localstorage or something
* Option to import/export games to files
